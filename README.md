# Projects
This is my first attempt to make a 2D envirnoment for an open world game.This was made via Pygame ,a famous python library for making games.
This includes a player which can be controlled ,with camera movement,also has sheeps which are animated and given diffrent by another python code.apart from these ther are special non animated objects like the trees,rocks 
and grass etc which are randomly placed at diffrent places.Each object has atleast two variant for each.
